## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict stock prices using historical data. The LightGBM model is employed due to its efficiency and high performance in handling large datasets.

## Data Description
The dataset includes stock prices from the JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange. The key features include:
- **Date**: Trading date
- **Open**: Opening price
- **High**: Highest price of the day
- **Low**: Lowest price of the day
- **Close**: Closing price
- **Volume**: Trading volume

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves visualizing the data to understand its structure and patterns. Key analyses include:
## Interactive Visualizations

You can view the interactive visualizations [here](file:///C:/Users/Elish/Downloads/jpx_market_analysis.html).
- Trend analysis over time
- Seasonal patterns
- Correlation between different stock prices

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating lag features)
- Normalizing or scaling features if necessary

## Model Building
The model is built using the LightGBM algorithm, which is suitable for large datasets and provides robust performance. Key steps include:
- Splitting data into training and validation sets
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Training the model

## Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## Conclusion
The model provides a predictive framework for stock prices, showing significant potential in forecasting trends. 

## Future Work
Future improvements could involve:
- Incorporating more features like economic indicators
- Trying other machine learning models like XGBoost or neural networks
- Real-time prediction system implementation
